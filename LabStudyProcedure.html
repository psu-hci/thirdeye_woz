    <h1>Lab Study Procedure</h1>
    <h2>Introduction Dialogue</h2>
    <p>“Hello, and welcome to the Alex personal shopping assistant! I will be helping you find and get some items off
     of some store shelves today. To assist us with this job, I have a pre-programmed list of a few items we’ll be
     picking up. If you have any questions for me at any time, just say ‘Hey, Alex’. Why don’t you try saying that now 
    just to make sure I can hear you?"</p>
    <p>“Ok, great I can hear you loud and clear. The first item that’s on the shopping list for today is a box of 
    <em>Frosted Flakes</em>. One of the lab assistants can help you reach that location in our mini 
    grocery store. Once we’re at the Frosted Flakes, we can try to find the item on the shelf.”<br />
    <b>(After arrival at Frosted Flakes):</b> “Ok, you’ve arrived at the cereal. It looks like there is a cheaper generic brand of
     Frosted Flakes available. Are you interested in getting those instead?”<br />
    ->If Yes, switch to generic frosted flakes.<br />
    ->If No, continue with Frosted Flakes.<br />
    <b>After selection:</b>“Whenever you’re ready, just extend your hand in the direction of the shelf. 
    For this item, we will be try a sound-based location method. When you hear a sound in your left ear like this (play sound), that is an 
    indication to move your hand to the left. When you hear a sound in your right ear like this (play sound), that is an indication to move your
     hand to the right. When your hand is hovering in front of the item, you will hear this noise (-play noise-). Hearing this sound (play sound)
     means to move your hand down, while hearing this sound (play sound) means to move your hand up. When you hear this noise, (play celebratory noise),
     you have located the item and can reach forward to grab it. You can go ahead and start whenever you are ready.”</p>
    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <p>“The next item on our list is some Stubb’s Original BBQ Sauce. One of the lab assistants can help you get to that section of our shelves now.”
    <br />
    “Ok stop here. This time, to find and retrieve this BBQ sauce, we will be using the mixed audio and haptic feedback tools through the glove. 
    We can begin whenever you’re ready.”
    <br />
    “Now just move your hand forward and grab the Stubb’s BBQ sauce. I’ll continue to play this sound (-play sound-) and pulse intermittently 
    to let you know you’re reaching forward correctly. If you fall off path, I’ll let you know.”
    <br />
    “Ok, let’s move on to the next item on the list then.
    </p>
    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <p>
    “The final item on our list is some Progressive Chicken Noodle Soup. One of the lab assistants can help you get to that section of our shelves now.”
    <br />
    “Ok we are in front of the soups now. This time, to find and retrieve the soup, we will be used the haptic glove to help guide you. Before getting the soup, 
    it looks like there is currently a 2-for-1 sale on this item. Would you like to get two cans of soup or one?”
    <br />
    “Now just move your hand forward and grab the Progresso Chicken Noodle Soup. I’ll pulse intermittently to let you know you’re reaching forward correctly. If you fall off path, I’ll let you know.”
